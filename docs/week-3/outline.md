# Outline

In this week we will study regression, a supervised learning problem, and a simple yet powerful ML technique called linear regression that tries to solve the problem. Specifically, we will try to answer the following questions:



- What is a linear regression model?
- How do we solve for $\theta$ in the equation $X\theta = 0$?
- How do we solve for $\theta$ in the equation $X\theta = y$?
- How do we solve for $\theta$ in $X\theta \approx y$?
- What does a linear model look like?
- Geometrically, what is the relationship between the approximation $X \hat{\theta}$ and the vector $y$?



We will be working with a labeled dataset of the form $(X, y)$.
