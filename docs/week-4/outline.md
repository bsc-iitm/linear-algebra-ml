# Outline

For the next three weeks, our setting will be unsupervised learning. We won't have access to the label vector $y$. The only thing that is in our possession is the data matrix $X$. Our goal for the next three weeks will be to develop tools to "understand data". The notion of "understanding data" is rather vague, but we will try to arrive at a reasonable understanding of it. 

In this week, we will focus on concepts called eigenvalues and eigenvectors which are the building blocks for the methods that we will develop in weeks 5 and 6. Though we have been using the variable $X$ for the data-matrix all through last week, it would be convenient to use the variable $A$ for the next few weeks.
